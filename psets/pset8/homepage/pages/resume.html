                <h3>2011 Census of India Webscraper</h3>
                <p>My first "freelancing" job. I was given this project by a cousin. Basically, I created a webscraper using Selenium in Python that scraped every village in every town in every district in every state in India. I did this by utilizing multiprocessing. The vast number of iterations resulted in the program repeatedly crashing. In order to fix this, I created a process for each state that wrote the data into a JSON file. Then, I combined all of those JSON files into a single JSON file. </p>

                <h3>Galax Fight</h3>
                <p>I created a mobile game using Swift and SpriteKit. This was a personal project that I decided to do in order to expand my horizons. I learned Swift for iOS in order to do this. I created a two-player shooter game. You can find Galax Fight on the App Store for iOS. </p>

                <h3>COVID-19 API</h3>
                <p>I created  COVID-19 API. I used Selenium in Python to scrape a certain website that contained statistics about COVID 19. The data I scraped included total deaths in the country, each state, each county, as well as total infections, death rates, infection rates, and more. I wrote all of this information to a JSON file. I then used FastAPI in Python to create endpoints to access the data from the JSON file. After that, I created a small EC2 AWS instance from Amazon to get the API running. Currently, the EC2 instance has been discontinued, so that API is not running. </p>

                <h3>Square Shootr</h3>
                <p>I created a computer game using C# and the Unity Game Engine. It is a forever-lasting top-down shooter game where you are a triangular-looking player that has to shoot at the squares that are coming at you. You can also get power ups on the way. </p>
